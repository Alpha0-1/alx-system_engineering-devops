Shell I/O redirections project
Task-0: echo "Hello World" prints the quoted words as output in a new line.
Task-1: echo "\"(Ã”o)'" displays the confused smiley from the executable file.
Task-2: cat /etc/passwd is the executable command that opens the file in question and displays its contents.
Task-3: cat /etc/passwd /etc/hosts displays the contents of both files. The space between the two files directs the computer to display the contents of two separate files.
Task-4: tail /etc/passwd displays the last ten lines of the file "/etc/passwd" because that is the work of the command "tail".
Task-5: head /etc/paswd displays the first 10 lines of the file because that is the function of the command "head"
